# LearnOpenGL-Rewrite
Going through LearnOpenGL (learnopengl.com) rewriting the code to match my style and hopefully have something resembling a reusable engine.

Written in C++ using Microsoft Visual Studio 2015. I steered clear of VS 2017 because I might want to add Bullet Physics. I know depsite Microsoft working with the Bullet Physics for VS 2017 the process is unclear and confusing at the moment and I didn't want to have that problem in the future.



Dependencies: 

OpenGL32 3.3 - this is because the tutorials recommended using at a minimum of this version or higher, but the benifits of using this version are that I will be able to work on this project on older computers if I needed to.

GLFW -  creates an OpenGL context, defines window parameters and handles user input

GLAD - Multi-Language GL Loader-Generator
